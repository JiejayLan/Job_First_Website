# Authentication

## Description:
The authentication of the application is done using the service provided by __AWS Amplify__. If a user
want to apply to a job or posting a job as employer. He/she will be required to log in.

## Sign up:
The information that we required from user is very little because we want to simplify the sign up process
as much as possible. The information that we need is: username, password, email, name, phone number and indication
if whether to register as employer or employee.

## Login:
We have two different way to login. One of them is in a new page. When a user trying to access a protected route,
he/she will be directed to the login page. The other way to login is in a modal component. The idea is that, the pop
up modal suppose to let the user stay on the same page after login, while the log in page will redirect the user to the homepage after
login.
