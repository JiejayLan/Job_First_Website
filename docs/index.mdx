## About:
JobFirst is a web app which utilizes _Gatsby_ to serve the frontend and _AWS Amplify_ to serve the backend. And blah blah blah....
## [Refer here for our weekly meeting status](https://github.com/Kaihchen1230/csc47300Project/wiki/Weekly-Status-Meeting-PPT)

## For the developers:
- __READ FIRST__
### Fresh start: (RECOMMENDED)
1. Delete your local
2. Delete your repo
3. Fork from [Kai](https://github.com/Kaihchen1230/csc47300Project.git)
4. __(optional)__ On the github repo, delete the unnessascery branch such as:
    A. _frontend-branch_
    B. _local-branch_ (I believe this is where Kai write his code)
5. On the github repo, set _newFrontend_ as the default branch
6. ```git clone [your own repo link]```
7. ```git branch``` you should be in _newFrontend_ branch
8. ```npm install``` install the dependencies
9. __(optional)__ ```amplify configure``` create a IAM role for this project __SAVE THE ACCESS ID AND ACCESS KEY__
10. ```amplify init``` initialize the amplify backend
__USE A DIFFERENT ENV__
__USE A DIFFERENT ENV__
__USE A DIFFERENT ENV__
 You can name it as _younameenv_ ex: _alanenv_
__USE YOUR OWN PROFILE__
__USE YOUR OWN PROFILE__
You can find [more information here](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/cli/init?sdk=js) about amplify command. If you have created too many profiles you can also find the file where your profiles are being recorded and then delete 'em.
11. ```amplify push``` so your backend will be in the cloud
12. Begin coding...

### Adding new Amplify service:
- In this example I will be adding an API
1. ```git pull``` upstream whateverbranch we use Get the latest update from upstream. We probably use the _newFrontend_ branch. So all of our pull requeast will go to _newFrontend_.
2. ```npm install``` run this after every pull from the upstream
3. ```amplify init``` to sync with the backend from upstream because someone else might add something to the backend already.
__USE THE EXISTING ENV FROM PREV SECTION STEP 10__

4. ```amplify push``` now your backend should be the same front upstream and when you run ```gatsby develop``` it should be working
5. ```amplify add api``` to add the service that you want to add. In this case, it's api
6. ```amplify push``` Set it up according your needs:
     define the schema
     write custom graphql
     etc...
7. __test it out to see if your backend is working__
8. ```git push``` Push it to your repo to make pull request.
9. Create the pull request.

### Testing:
```npm test``` or ```npm test -- -- watch```

### Document:
```put all docs file under docs folder``` and ```npm run docz:dev```
