Currently, Shawn is living in Brooklyn 8th Ave where most the Chinese is living. He rent a room in the basement and paying 700 every month. Before comming to the United States, Shawn work as a web developer for a startup company in China until the company goes bankrupt. He has interest in technology since he was very young. When he was young, he will download the source code of some programs and change something just to see what will happen.
<p> Now Shawn is working as a part time worker who stands on the street everyday to distribute the newspaper and brochure. Everyday Shawn wakes up at 6a.m. so he can start working at 7a.m. to get the newspaper to all the other people when they are going to work. On a typical day, Shawn will finish his work by 10a.m. depends on the weather. A raining or snowing day will make him staying longer on the street. After that, Shawn will go to a Chinese restaurant to get some lunch and then continue to distribute the brochure until around 3p.m. It isn't an easy job to stand on the street no matter what kind of weather.
<p> When Shawn first come to the United States, he tried to find a job that relate to his background. But he couldn't do so and there is no one in the United States to help him out. With all the bills and rent to pay, Shawn has to take whatever offer that he can get in order to get the money for living. That's why he end up working to distribute the newspaper and brochure. Shawn will like to get back to the field of web development but he couldn't do so because he has been of track for almost four years. Although he doesn't speak fluent English but after spending three years in the United States, he is manage to handle the basic to cope with the daily problem. Shawn said English will not be the barrier since he can speak in "computer language", so he is really hoping to get back in the field of web development but there is just simply no company will accept him.
