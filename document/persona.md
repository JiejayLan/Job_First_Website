<p> xiyan Liu is a 32 years old new immigrant from China. She work as Popeye's cashier at Flushing, her salary is 15$/hour. Totally 525 $ per week. She lives in Brooklyn with parents and cousin in a public department. All of them came to America at 2016. She is still single now. She has a bachelor degree in art design from Guangzhou University at China.She had 5 years of fashion design experience in China. She was a team leader of ten people in her pre-company.
<p> She need to work 5 days a week. During her weekday, she needs to get up at 8:00 am. After breakfast and makeup, she needs to take N train to Flushing, which takes her more than 3 hours on the train. Once she arrives the store, she need to order food for customers without stop. Only when there is less customer around 2 pm, she can have half hour break to eat some food. She is a pre-fashion designer at China. She is not happy with this job. She can't discuss fashion design with her colleagues. Around 4 pm, she will finish her one day work and go home. During the weekend, she will attend an English ESL free workshops at Chinatown. But that is not a good organized class, she can't learn too much from that. At nighttime, when she arrive home, she will spend some time on English and also watch some fashion design news.
<p> She want to learn more English in an organized way, instead of from some small non-organized workshop. Also she want to continue her career in fashion design, even a startup is ok for her. Have a master degree at America helps, but it takes a lot of time to prepare language test and gre or gmat. It also cost a lot of money. So this is not her first option now.

Everyday Shawn wakes up at 6a.m. so he can start working at 7a.m. to get the newspaper to all the other people when they are going to work. On a typical day, Shawn will finish his work by 10a.m. depends on the weather. A raining or snowing day will make him staying longer on the street. After that, Shawn will go to a Chinese restaurant to get some lunch and then continue to distribute the brochure until around 3p.m. It isn't an easy job to stand on the street no matter what kind of weather.
<p> When Shawn first come to the United States, he tried to find a job that relate to his background. But he couldn't do so and there is no one in the United States to help him out. With all the bills and rent to pay, Shawn has to take whatever offer that he can get in order to get the money for living. That's why he end up working to distribute the newspaper and brochure. Shawn will like to get back to the field of web development but he couldn't do so because he has been of track for almost four years. Although he doesn't speak fluent English but after spending three years in the United States, he is manage to handle the basic to cope with the daily problem. Shawn said English will not be the barrier since he can speak in "computer language", so he is really hoping to get back in the field of web development but there is just simply no company will accept him.

<p> Sunny Zhang is a 27 year old assistant at a family member’s business and earns very little. He is a married man who lives in Brooklyn. Currently, he lives with his parents in an apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He does not meet immigration requirements for many jobs. His educational background shows that he obtained a bachelor’s degree in business before moving to the U.S. He has 3 years of experience being a business analyst at a bank.
<p>As a recent immigrant, most of his day is spent searching both online and outside for a highly skilled job as an analyst. In the meantime, he is frequently outside looking for a temporary job just to make ends meet. In addition, his host family is trying to help him find a suitable position, but to little avail. He wakes up early every morning to do this, and in the day works in a small position at a family member’s business. He does not have flexible hours, and frequently comes home very late. It is difficult to support his wife and child.
<p> Sunny needs an informational source that can help find the best opportunity based on the skills that he has obtained. He needs a tool that can help break barriers such as language and lack of knowledge on legal immigration laws. In addition, he quickly needs to find a suitable job or at least know what the options are in order to begin settling in to the new country. Lastly, he needs to assimilate soon because of the urge to support family that are overseas, as well as his immediate family.

<p> Wang is a 21 years old and just came to USA 3 months ago under family immigration. Wang is currently living with his parents in Queens Elmhurst. Before he came to USA, he just completed a well-known front-end web devlopment bootcamp in China, Mainland. Also, he received a handful of internship offers from a few well tech campanies in China. Before the bootcamp, he received his associated degree on business from a community college at his hometown. 
<p> Wang started to work as a waiter at his father's resturant the second day that he came to USA and works 7 days a week. On a typical day, he would wake up at 9:00 am to take a run for 30 minutes in his neighbourhood and go to resturant with his father at 10:00 am and help out with preparing the ingredients before opening. Usually he has his lunch break around 5:00 pm , but it depends on the resturant busyness. He get out at 11:00 pm, the time that resturant closed.
<p> Deep in Wang's mind, he knows that he doesn't want to work as a waiter in a resturant for the rest of his life. He still got the passion about front-end web development and would like to find a relatived job or internship or volunteer to help him to adapt America's tech world. However, nobody in Wang's family or family acquaintances can provide this kind of support, because none of them finish colleges or work in technology field. Most of them work in resturant for their entire lives. On top of that, he is unable to pursue a bachelor’s degree in USA due to expensive college tuition and language barrier.

<p> Xiaoming is a 30 years old Chinese new immigrant that currently living New York City. He earned a Bachelor degree in computer science back in China and had worked as computer programmer in Shenzhen China for 5 years. 2 years ago he came to United State, however due his language difficulty he was never able to pass the interview for a position that he wants and fits his education and experience. He is currently working as a restaurant server and live in small apartment in 8th Ave Brooklyn. Xiaoming can understand and read some English but cannot communicate fluently in English. He has a fiancee that is a public elementary school teacher and they are planning to get marry soon. As the wedding days getting closer, he worries about their future as he believe that a waiter earning is not enough to provide a better life for his wife and children.
<p> Xiaoming started his typical by taking a D train to get to his restaurant around 9:00am. Around 12:30 he will take a hour lunch. He will eat dinner at the restaurant and return home around 9:00pm, Monday through Friday. The restaurant he works at is a Chinese restaurant at Chinatown he tasks are taking order, serving meal, and cleaning aftermath. His wage is $12 per hours and around $50 tips per day. After he is back home he will spend two hours to do some reading and browsing internet. Then he will go to sleep. On Saturday, he will spend the whole day with his fiancee either to stay home or hangout. On Sunday, he will either stay home to self-study, hangout with his friends or to do some shopping. Each month, Xiaoming has to pay $1000 for his rent and sent $500 to his parents. These leave him no room to go to language school to improve his English both time wise and economic wise.
<p> Xiaoming is not please with his current situation. His job is taking away too much of his time and it is not helping him to grow. In additional, it is not something that he want to do or train for. He wants to work on something related to computer programming, so that he can continue his career that started back in China. However, his language difficulty isn't something that can be overcome easily or quickly. It will take long time to solve. During these time, his knowledge and experience will all be wasted. Also He cannot guarantee the knowledge he possess will still be useful few years later. He also cannot afford to not being working as his marriage is coming, he has to provide economic support to his family. He really want to work for someone that is in the computer program business In this way he will be in touch with the industry that he is interested while he is improving his English skill.
